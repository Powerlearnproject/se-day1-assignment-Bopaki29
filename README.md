Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-software engineering is part of computer science that deals in designing and maintaining software.
Software engineering is an important part of computer science, without it the would be poor software which means lots and lots of bug, security issues that mean a lot of data being stolen and ransomware would dominate and unreliable software which means businesses would lose money and that cause society to fall . Software engineering in not just important but extremely valuable.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. mastering machine (1956-1967): mastering hardware dependent
high level language
2. mastering complexity(around the 1968-1982):Crisis. Development process
software engineering
Ensure correctness. 
3. mastering process (which was around the 1983-1992):Personal computer. Expanding
data and functional convergence
4. mastering communication (1993-2001):Internet. Client/server
complex projects
5. mastering productive (2003-2010):Conceptual level expansion
Customer
6. mastering markets(2011-...):Outsourcing services
Orchestrating services

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
Planning- identify the software requirements or purposes
Requirements analysis - so find what is desired
Designing - building the framework 
Coding - converting software design into code
Testing - making sure that the software meets the required software design and make sure the are no bug.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
framework 
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
Project Manager - assembles,lead the software development team, make sure the project goes accordingly and make sure that projects meets the requirements of the stakeholders.




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.
agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints).
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements.
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

importance:

Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git

importance:

Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.

Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification.

-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.

Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.

Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats

Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users.

Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.

 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.

 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.

 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .

Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.

- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
 

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Importance:

Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.

Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of a person

Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.

Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.

Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.

Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
